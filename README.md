<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

this project starts as an alternative to the problem that was presented to us. 

with this I could merge my habbilities and capacitations: cartograpy, geography, design.

Here's why:
* At field work we meet with the need of update informatios about of these beneficiaries.
* the form represents the available options as an example. But, you can add other entries depending on the needs.
* If the field work need a auto geolcation, this proyect it have. But, allow to consult the handling of the geolocator manually.
* Submit geolocates, name and descriptions by defoult.
* Connecto with database, and save de informations submited.

Finally, process the field information, instead. Searching manually the placce in the map.
